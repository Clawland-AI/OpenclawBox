**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## Clawland Inc Launches ClawBox on Kickstarter: The First Open-Source Personal AI Appliance

*Plug-and-play device routes across 38+ AI models, saves up to 90% on inference costs, and keeps your data private*

**[City], June 2026** — Clawland Inc today launched [ClawBox](https://www.kickstarter.com/) on Kickstarter, a personal AI appliance that gives users a single, always-on device to access any AI model through a standard OpenAI-compatible API.

ClawBox sits on your desk and routes AI requests across 38+ models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and others — automatically selecting the cheapest capable model for each task. The result: up to 90% cost reduction compared to using a single premium model, with automatic failover if any provider goes down.

### Key Features

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Any app or tool that works with OpenAI works with ClawBox — no code changes
- **Smart routing**: 14-dimension weighted scoring routes each request to the optimal model
- **Auto-failover**: Provider down? Rate limited? ClawBox switches automatically
- **Touchscreen display**: 7.9" bar touchscreen shows live status, routing info, and QR pairing
- **Fleet management**: Monitor and manage multiple devices from a web dashboard
- **Open source**: Entire software stack is open-source (Apache-2.0) at [github.com/Clawland-AI/OpenclawBox](https://github.com/Clawland-AI/OpenclawBox)

### Pricing and Availability

ClawBox is available in two editions:

- **Starter Edition**: Starting at $179 (Early Bird), $199 regular
- **Pro Edition**: Starting at $269 (Early Bird), $299 regular

The Kickstarter campaign goal is $100,000. Estimated delivery: September 2026.

ClawBox is powered by OpenclawBox, an open-source platform that integrates [ClawRouter](https://github.com/BlockRunAI/ClawRouter) (MIT license, 3,300+ GitHub stars) for intelligent model routing, with Clawland-Fleet for device management and OTA updates.
